# l2a (Learn to Add)

## Description

This is a small project which aims to show an example of applied machine 
learning in Python 3 with the Keras library and its TensorFlow backend to 
train a neural network model for it to learn to add two integers.

The project also aims to follow the 7 Steps of Machine Learning presented by 
Google in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKW8Ndu7Mjw) YouTube video.
